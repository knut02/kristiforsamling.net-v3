Lord, I'm a hard fighting soldier  
on the battlefield (x3)  
And I'll be bringing souls to Jesus  
by the service that I give

I've got a helmet on my head  
in my hand a sword and shield (x3)  
And I'll be bring souls to Jesus  
by the service that I give

You've gotta walk right and talk right and  
sing right and pray right on the battlefield (x3)  
And I'll be bringing souls to Jesus  
by the service that I give

I know that Jesus is my Captain  
and He fights my battle still  
He has never lost a battle  
and I know he never will  
I got the Bible for my sword  
and I got faith for my shield  
And I'll be bringing souls to Jesus  
by the service that I give

And when I die let me die  
in the service of my Lord (x3)  
And I'll be bringing souls to Jesus  
by the service that I give
