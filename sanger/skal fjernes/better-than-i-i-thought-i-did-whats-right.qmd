I thought I did what's right  
I thought I had the answers  
I thought I chose the surest road  
But that road brought me here  
So I put up a fight  
And told you how to help me  
Now just when I have given up  
The truth is coming clear  
You know better than I  
You know the way  
I've let go the need to know why  
For you know better than I

If this has been a test  
I cannot see the reason  
But maybe knowing I don't know  
Is part of getting through
