I try to do what's best  
And faith has made it easy  
To see the best thing I can do  
Is put my trust in you

For You know better than I  
You know the way  
I've let go the need to know why  
For you know better than I

I saw one cloud and thought it was a sky  
I saw a bird and thought that I could follow  
But it was you who taught that bird to fly  
If I let you reach me will you teach me

For You know better than I  
You know the way  
I've let go the need to know why  
I'll take what answers you supply  
You know better than I
