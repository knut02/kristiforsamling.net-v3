**Chorus:**  
Now give me that old time religion  
Give me that old time religion  
Give me that old time religion  
It's good enough for me

It was good for our mothers,...  
Makes me love everybody,...  
It was good for our fathers,...  
It was good for the Hebrew children,...  
It was good for Paul and Silas,....  
It will do when I am dying,...  
It was good for the prophet Daniel,...  
It was tried in the fiery furnace,...  
It will take us all to heaven,...


> Ved midnattstid holdt Paulus og Silas bønn og sang lovsanger til Gud, mens fangene lyttet til dem. Med ett kom et jordskjelv så kraftig at grunnmuren i fengslet ristet. Straks sprang alle dørene opp, og alles lenker falt av.  
> Apg. 16:25-26
